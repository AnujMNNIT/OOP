/**
 The new operator dynamically allocates memory for an object and returns a reference to it.
 * This reference is the address in memory of the object allocated by new. A reference is an
   address that indicates where an objectâ€™s variables, methods etc. are stored.
   The objects are not actually used when assigned to a variable or passed as an argument to a method .
   The references to objects are used everywhere. 
 */

/*In java, the memory allocated at runtime i.e. heap area can be made free by the process of garbage collection.
It is nothing but just a method of making the memory free which is not being used by the programmer.
Only the objects who have no longer reference to them are eligible for garbage collection in java.
object can not become a candidate for garbage collection until all references to it are discarded.

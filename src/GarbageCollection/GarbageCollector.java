/*
 In C/C++, programmer is responsible for both creation and destruction of objects. Usually programmer neglects
destruction of useless objects. Due to this negligence, at certain point, for creation of new objects, sufficient 
memory may not be available and entire program will terminate abnormally causing OutOfMemoryErrors.
But in Java, the programmer need not to care for all those objects which are no longer in use. Garbage collector destroys these objects.
Garbage collector is best example of Daemon thread as it is always running in background.
Main objective of Garbage Collector is to free heap memory by destroying unreachable objects.

 Unreachable objects : An object is said to be unreachable if it doesnâ€™t contain any reference to it. Also note that objects which are part of island of isolation are also unreachable.
